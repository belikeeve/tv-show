A re-interpretation of the "Hometown Homepage" challenge on [Scrimba's Fullstack Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/fullstack-path-c0fullstack).

## Sandbox

## Live demo
[RuPaul's Drag Race - The Werk Room](https://sprightly-paprenjak-510104.netlify.app/)

## Overview

The original task was to recreate a Figma design of a simple tourism web page, for your hometown or country.

I changed the context to a landing page for the ever-popular, multi Emmy award-winning show, RuPaul's Drag Race, focusing on The Werk Room as the legendary prep space for the show's competing drag queens.

### Elements

The project is a landing page with three sections:

- **Section One** is the hero section and introduction. It contains:
  - A background image
  - A `h1` heading as the main title
  - A brief `p`aragraph to describe The Werk Room

- **Section Two** is a container of "missions", reflecting the kinds of things drag queens get up to on the show. It contains:
  - A `h2Â´ heading title
  - Three columns, each one containing:
      - A `h3` heading
      - An image (I used GIFs)
      - A short explainer for the mission
        
- **Section Three** contains:
  - An image of RuPaul, exec producer and host of the show
  - A `h4` heading
  - A paragraph with RuPaul's signature catchphrase
